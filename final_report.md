**Final Report: Preprocessing and Dataset Splitting**

In this project, we performed preprocessing and dataset splitting on a FIFA 21 dataset. The dataset contained information about football players, including various attributes such as player ratings, physical attributes, and personal details.

**Preprocessing Steps:**

1. **Data Loading:** We loaded the FIFA 21 dataset using pandas, adjusting the `low_memory` parameter to handle potential memory issues due to mixed data types.
2. **Handling Missing Values:** We identified and analyzed missing values in the dataset, recognizing columns with significant missing data.
3. **Outlier Detection:** We focused on relevant numeric columns and detected outliers using the interquartile range (IQR) method. Outliers can affect the robustness and accuracy of models, so removing them is crucial.
4. **Feature Selection:** We selected relevant numeric columns for outlier detection and subsequent analysis.

**Dataset Splitting:**

- **Training and Testing Sets:** We split the preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from the scikit-learn library. This splitting allows us to train machine learning models on one subset of the data and evaluate their performance on another subset, ensuring unbiased performance assessment.
- **No Specific Target Variable:** Since no specific target variable was chosen for this splitting, the dataset was divided into feature sets only, without considering a specific prediction task.

**Potential Uses of Preprocessed Data:**

1. **Model Training:** The preprocessed dataset can be utilized to train machine learning models for various tasks, such as player performance prediction, team composition analysis, or player valuation.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analysts and researchers can explore the preprocessed data to gain insights into player attributes, identify trends, or perform comparative analyses across different player characteristics.
3. **Player Profiling:** Coaches, scouts, and team managers can use the preprocessed data to profile players based on their skills, physical attributes, and potential, aiding in recruitment, team strategy development, and player development programs.
4. **Performance Evaluation:** The preprocessed dataset can serve as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of existing models or developing new predictive models for tasks such as player rating prediction, match outcome prediction, or team performance estimation.

Overall, the preprocessing and dataset splitting procedures enable the utilization of the FIFA 21 dataset for various analytical and predictive tasks in the domain of football analytics, player management, and sports data science.
