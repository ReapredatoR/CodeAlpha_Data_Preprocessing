# Data Preprocessing for FIFA 21 Dataset

## Purpose:

The Data Preprocessing for FIFA 21 Dataset project focuses on preparing the dataset for further analysis and modeling by handling missing values, outliers, and scaling features as necessary. It also involves splitting the data into training and testing sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.

## Data Science Task:

The primary objective of this project is to preprocess the FIFA 21 dataset to ensure data quality and suitability for predictive modeling tasks. Key preprocessing steps include handling missing values, identifying and addressing outliers, and standardizing feature scales. Additionally, the dataset will be partitioned into training and testing subsets to support model development and validation.

## Objectives:

1. **Handling Missing Values:** Implement strategies to address missing values in the dataset, such as imputation or deletion, to maintain data integrity.
2. **Dealing with Outliers:** Identify outliers in the data and apply appropriate techniques, such as trimming or transformation, to mitigate their impact on analysis and modeling.
3. **Feature Normalization/Scaling:** Normalize or scale features as needed to ensure consistent ranges and improve model performance.
4. **Data Splitting:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets to enable model training on one subset and evaluation on another, facilitating unbiased performance assessment.

## About Dataset:
